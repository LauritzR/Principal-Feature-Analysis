# paramters for the PFA
# number_output_functions: Number of output features that are to be modeled, i.e. the number of components of the vector-valued output-function. The values are stored in the first number_output_functions rows of the csv-file.
# number_sweeps: Number of sweeps of the PFA. The result of the last sweep is returned.
                # In addition, the return of each sweep are interesected and returned as well.
# cluster_size: number of nodes of a subgraph in the principal_feature_analysis
# alpha=0.01: Level of significance
# min_n_datapoints_a_bin: minimum number of data points for each bin in the chi-square test
# shuffle_feature_numbers: if True the number of the features is randomly shuffled
# frac: the fraction of the dataset that is used for the analysis. The set is randomly sampled from the input csv
# calculate_mutual_information: if True the mutual information with features from the PFA with the components of the output function is calculated
# basis_log_mutual_information: basis of the logarithm used in the calculation of the mutual information
